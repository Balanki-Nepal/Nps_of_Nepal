					<h5>Introduction</h5>
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langtang_National_Park"> Langtang National Park</a> was established in 1976 as Nepal's first Himalayan national park and the country's fourth protected area. It exceeds an altitudinal range of 6,450 m
					(21,160 ft) and covers an area of 1,710 km2 (660 sq mi) in the Nuwakot, Rasuwa and Sindhulpalchok Districts of the central Himalayan region encompassing 26 village communities. In the north and east it is linked with Qomolangma National
					Nature Preserve in Tibet Autonomous Region. The western boundary follows the Bhote Koshi and the Trishuli river. The southern border lies 32 km (20 mi) north of the Kathmandu Valley.
					The high altitude sacred Gosainkunda lake is located at an altitude of 4,300 m (14,100 ft) inside the park. The Dorje Lakpa range at 6,988 m (22,927 ft) bisects the park from west–east to south–east. The summit of Langtang Lirung (7,245 m
					(23,770 ft)) is the highest point in the park.
					Langtang National Park is part of the Sacred Himalayan Landscape.

					<h5>History:</h5>
					<p>
						In 1970, royal approval designated the establishment of Langtang National Park as the first protected area in the Himalayas. The national park was gazetted in 1976 and extended by a buffer zone of 420 km2 (160 sq mi) in 1998.[1] Under the
						Buffer Zone Management Guidelines the conservation of forests, wildlife and cultural resources received top priority, followed by conservation of other natural resources and development of alternative energy.
						On 31 July 1992, Thai Airways International Flight 311 crashed into the park. The Airbus A310 was on approach to Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu. All 113 people on board were killed.><br />

					<h5>Climate</h5>
					<p>
						September through May offers a variety of natural splendors, from lush temperate river valleys with screeching langur to spectacular old growth forest and glacial-craved cliffs rimmed by snow-covered peaks. The weather is also relatively
						dry except January-February when one may come across snow.Autumn is the best time to visit the Park. By April bursts of red, pink, and while rhododendrons stretch into towering canopies of fir and oak forests. Advent of warm weather makes
						the Yak and Chauri herds ascend to higher elevation, making occasional camps in the pasturelands, to follow years of tradition. From June to august, skies are heavy with monsoon rains. During August, a lively festival at Gosaikunda Lake
						attracts thousands of Hindu pilgrims and September witnesses’ spectacular display of wild flowers, while livestock herds, once again, return to lower pastures.<br /><br />

						Rainfall :<br />

						The seasonal climatic pattern is dominated by the southerly monsoon, which occurs between June and September. The incidence and type of precipitation is a mainly assorted effect of aspect, altitude and the presence of a rain shadow area
						(e.g. Langtang and Lende Valleys). The north-south aligned Helambu drainage basins are exposed to the full effect of monsoon air streams, as far west as the upper Tadi Khola. Rainfall data shows that Sermathang and Tarkeghyang receive the
						most precipitation. The Langtang and Lende valleys are sheltered from southerly airstreams by the Gosainkunda Lekh-Dorje Lhakpa Range and Langtang Himal respectively. Consequently, monsoon arrives later and departs earlier from these
						inner valleys. The drainage of the park can be divided into two main watersheds. South of the Gosaikunda Lekh-Dorje Lhakpa range, drainage is southwards and then east into the Soon Koshi. The drainage north of this is initially westwards
						into theBhotekoshi-Trisuli rivers and then southwards. The park occupies a tectonically interesting and important geographic position within the Nepal Central Himalayas. Igneous, metamorphic and migmatite rock types are found within the
						park. Hot springs, occurring near Timure and Syafrubesi along the Bhote Koshi, are an indication of deep-seated tectonic activity still present in these relatively young mountains.<br />

						The average monthly rainfall peaks in August in Kyangjin. Based on the 1989-98 observation of rainfall data supplied by the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, the maximum average rainfall is 160mm during this month. Average annual
						rainfall in Sermathan, based on the data from 1989 to 2006, slightly exceeds 900mm during July and the rainfall mostly occurs from June to September. Similarly, the average monthly rainfall reaches its peak in August in Dhunche with
						500mm. <br /><br />
						Temperature:<br />

						The average monthly maximum and minimum temperatures recorded in the Kyangjin Metroligical Station based on observations between 1989-1998 by the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology are presented in the following graphs with two
						moving averages of the previous and succeeding data. The temperature reaches its maximum point in July- August and falls to a minimum in December-January. The minimum average temperature falls below zero degree from November to April.
						Based on observation from 1989 to 2006, average monthly maximum temperature in Dhunche reaches 24 degrees and varies with narrow limit with this figure from May to September. Between December and January, the minimum temperature of the
						same meteorological stations falls below 5 degrees.<br /><br />

						Humidity:<br />

						Relative humidity data is only available in Dhunche station within Langtang National Park. Average monthly relative humidity is the highest between June and Oct exceeding 80% both in the mornings and evenings.</p><br />

					<h5>Vegetation:</h5>
					<p>
						The flora of the Park can be divided into three basic vegetation zone's-subtropical, temperate and alpine. In the lower altitudes (1000 - 2000 m), subtropical vegetation dominates the landscape; Forest mainly consists of Montane Sal,
						Pines
						and Alder species. From 1800 - 3000 m temperate type of forest dominates. The forest there are comprised of lower temperate mixed broad-leaved species (Lindera nacusua, Cinnamomum tamca. etc), temperate mixed evergreen species (Spruce,
						fir,
						hemlock, oak. etc), and upper temperate broad-leaved species (Aesculus indica, maple, etc.) Fir oak, birch, and rhododendron arc the major species found there. Intertwined into the landscape of the Khaptad plateau are the Patans with
						beautiful flowers (about 135 species) that bloom in the summer and late spring. The grassland flowers consist of primulas, buttercups, and wild berries. Also occurring inside the park is a wide variety of medicinal herbs (about 224
						species).

					<h5>Flora and Fauna:</h5>
					<p>
						Langtang National Park exhibits a high diversity of 14 vegetation types in 18 ecosystem types, ranging from upper tropical forests below 1,000 m (3,300 ft) m altitude to alpine scrub and perennial ice. Sub-tropical vegetation
						characterized by Sal (Shorea robusta) forest in the southern section of the park is gradually taken over by hill forest (2000-2600m) consisting of Chirpine, Rhododendron, and Nepalese alder. The temperate zone (2600-3000m) is covered
						mainly by oak forest fading to old growth forest of silver fir, hemlock, and larch in the lower sub-alpine zone (3000-3600m). The Nepalese larch (larixnepalensis), the only deciduous conifer in the region, is found in this park and few
						places elsewhere. Throughout these zones different species of Rhododendron such as R. arboretum, R. barbatum, R. campanulatum, and R. lepidotum (scrubs) to name a few, form a colorful under story. Tree species such as birch, silver fir,
						Sorbus microphyla and twisted Rhododendroncampanulatum are found near the tree line. It is here at 4000m Juniper and Rhododendron shrubs (R. anthopogon) slowly dissolve into expansive alpine grassland meadows. Langtang's expansive high
						meadows provide summer habitat for numerous ungulate species such as musk deer and Himalayan tahr. The park is also well known for its populations of red panda, Himalayan black bear, snow leopard, wild dog, ghoral, serow and more than 250
						species of birds.<br />
